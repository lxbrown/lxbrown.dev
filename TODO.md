Add Heroku to Cloud Platforms

Add FadeInImage to react-fade-in, based on:
```javascript
const [loaded, setLoaded] = useState(false);

const handleLoad = (() => {
    if (!loaded) {
        console.log('loaded');
        setLoaded(true);
    }
});

return (
    <>
    {!loaded ? (<img src={profile} alt="Profile" className="hidden" onLoad={handleLoad()} />) :
        (<FadeIn className="home" childClassName='homeElement'>
            <img src={profile} alt="Profile" className="photo fadein" onLoad={handleLoad()} />
            <p className="description fadein">...</p>
        </FadeIn>)}
    </>
```
